Control for a draggable ViewController gliding over another ViewController.

RDGliderViewController is a view controller that manages a scrollable view using one side as a sliding point, choosing between Left-to-Right, Top-to-Bottom, Right-to-Left and Bottom-to-Top, and setting an array of offsets as percent values to determine the gliding view steps, as described bellow.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` first.

## Installation

### Using CocoaPods

RDGliderViewController is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html):

```ruby
pod "RDGliderViewController"
```

### Using Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and then integrate **RDGliderViewController** into your Xcode project adding the following line into your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md):

```ruby
github "gelemias/RDGliderViewController"
```

### Manual Installation

For an old fashion installation you can directly add the **header** and **implementation** files for `RDGliderViewController` and `RDScrollView` to your project.

- Download the latest code version or add the repository as a git submodule to your git-tracked project.

- Drag and drop the mention files onto your project and make sure to select **Copy items** if needed.

- Add this `#import "RDGliderViewController.h"` at the beginning of your class.
